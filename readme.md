## rcrng

A simple function that achieves random number generation using race conditions.

```c
rcrng(uint16_t from, uint16_t to)
```

> [!NOTE]
> magic_number and thread_count are arbitrary; their value should depend on needs and hardware

### Flaws

**Scalability**

This implementation requires drastically more cpu cycles than f.e. RDRAND, with which one can generate a random number from 3 to 9 in about 350â€“520 cycles.

**Safety Concerns**

It's randomness can be influenced by: 

- OS scheduler
- CPU architecture 
- system load 
- compiler optimizations

Furthermore, system load and timing can be manipulated.

### Sample Results

The following tables summarize the results of rcrng over multiple sample batches where

Processor 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1215U, 1200 Mhz, 6 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)

```c
static uint32_t magic_number = 100000;
static const uint8_t thread_count = 6;
```
